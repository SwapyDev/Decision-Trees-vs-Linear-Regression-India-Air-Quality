# Digital Ecology: Air Quality Analysis
This project applies Machine Learning techniques to analyze environmental and ecological data, focusing on air quality assessment. The goal is to explore relationships between air pollutants and the Air Quality Index (AQI), without relying on deep learning.

##Features
-Multi-Scatter and Bubble Plot Analysis to visualize pollutants vs. AQI.
-Machine Learning Models for predicting AQI based on air pollutants.
-Comparison of Linear Regression and Decision Trees for AQI prediction.
-Data Preprocessing & Cleaning for accurate insights.
